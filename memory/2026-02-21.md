# 2026-02-21 Session Notes

## Cam's Weekend Build (Feb 20-21)

### Product Hacker: App Registry + Alignment Dashboard
- Centralized app registry (8 apps: Product Hacker, TaskCrush, Solo CRM, BlankSlate, Data Services, PeanutButter, Tribe, EarnQuest)
- Alignment scoring system fetching from Tao API (`/alignment/all`)
- 13 conformity checks tracked (GA tag, CLAUDE.md, Tao integration, etc.)
- Visual dashboard with color-coded progress bars + per-check badges
- Apps dashboard shows: open requests, shipped requests, feedback count, changelog entries

### Solo CRM Major Upgrades
- Photo attachments in chat with AI data extraction
- Google Calendar OAuth integration (read/write, day view, time block suggestions)
- Auto-prompt daily briefing (database-backed, calendar-aware)
- Timezone + working hours in user profile
- Inline feature request form on Requests tab
- 503 timeout fix (4 layers: timeout increases, retry logic, queue mgmt, error handling)

### Technical Context
- Tao workspace_id (renamed from project_id) in all apps
- Conformity checks define "Product Hacker conformant" standard
- Changelog table now has `app` column for cross-app tracking
- Feature requests use tags to map to apps

## Integration Questions (Open)
1. Is Tao `/alignment/all` endpoint live at `https://api.taodata.ai/alignment/all`?
2. Does Tao have app registry capability (store app metadata)?
3. Should HiveForge MCP have an app registry endpoint?
4. Where does conformity-check skill live? (System-level vs app-level)
5. What are Tribe and EarnQuest? (EarnQuest newly added to registry, no URL yet)

## Action Items (from CAM_SYNC.md)
- Cam: Confirm Tao alignment endpoint status, check app registry capability, decide conformity automation
- Jody: Review conformity-check skill location, update OpenClaw skills
- Agent: Test Tao alignment endpoint, propose HiveForge MCP enhancement

## Model Switch
- Switched agent model from Opus to Sonnet 4.5 per Jody's request (5x cost savings)

## Memory Match Game
- Reminder set for Jody (9 AM ET 2026-02-21) re: App Store submission
- Cam reported white-on-white text issue in TestFlight (3 installs, still persists)

## Launch Strategy
- TOMORROW.md created with week 1 plan: LinkedIn posts, data provider integration, Solo CRM 503 debug
- Data provider strategy: ContactOut + Discolike integration (Alex Southworth intro)
- Launch goal: "Use our tools to sell our tools" meta play
